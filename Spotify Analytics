# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.

# Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.

# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I imported the Sportify data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First, I looked at the average popularity and danceability by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB0.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

# Next, I looked at the top 5 artist and track by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB0.Spotifydata
Order by popularity DESC 
LIMIT 5;

# Finally, I looked at the average popularity of a single artist.
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) as popularity
FROM BIT_DB0.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Bad Bunny';
