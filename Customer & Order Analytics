#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB0.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB0.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity) * price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)as Quantity, SUM(Quantity) * price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.quantity > 2;
